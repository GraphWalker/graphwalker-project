// determining low-bandwidth via navigator.connection

// There are two iterations of the navigator.connection interface:

// The first is present in Android 2.2+ and only in the Browser (not WebView)
// : docs.phonegap.com/en/1.2.0/phonegap_connection_connection.md.html#connection.type
// : davidbcalhoun.com/2010/using-navigator-connection-android

// The second is specced at dev.w3.org/2009/dap/netinfo/ and perhaps landing in WebKit
// : bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73528

// unknown devices are assumed as fast
// for more rigorous network testing, consider boomerang.js: github.com/bluesmoon/boomerang/

Modernizr.addTest('lowbandwidth', function() {

  var connection = navigator.connection || { type: 0 }; // polyfill

  return connection.type == 3 || // connection.CELL_2G
      connection.type == 4 || // connection.CELL_3G
      /^[23]g$/.test(connection.type); // string value in new spec
});
